Users are guranteed the resources on their VPS web hosting account. This means that your account will always be allocated the set amount of RAM, CPU and Disk Space you've chosen regardless of what other users on the server are doing. This allows for greater stability and performance of your website. You also do not share the Operating System with any other users, providing better security for your website files. VPSes shre the underlying physical hardware with other VPSes, the performance may be slow.
